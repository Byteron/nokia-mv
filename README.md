Project Name: Get Out

Get Out is a dark, nightmarish side scroller about a boy who wakes up in a cave after an incident and faces his problems and anxieties, fights them with his hope and tries to escape the cave before the light of hope that shines within him fades away for good.

Mechanics

The core mechanic is to keep the hope of you character up, represented by the light of the characters torch.
Gather items (fuel?) to increase your hope
Enemies in the light of you torch will get damage and eventually die, but your hope decreases.
Static obstacles eating hope to free the way (your problems)
Attack the enemies to kill them. This forces the player to get close to the enemy, thus it will cost some hope, but it makes more sense as hope keeps you going, but does not solve your problems

Level Design

As a metroidvania-esque game, there should be multiple paths to end the level, as well as life has multiple paths you can choose from to get further in life.
While there should be multiple paths, they should be designed so that the player, while challenged in where to go, never feels lost.
To support the fact that our character is at the bottom and has to “fight himself up again”, the level design should lead the player upwards.  Likewise, if the player is going way too downwards, it might signify that they’re going in the wrong way.
To support fighting the characters anxieties / problems, reward paths with more enemies with more torches to give him more hope. It should reflect that it’s a good thing to face and fight their problems. Not always, but often.
problems (aka doors) are static obstacles that need a solution to be destroyed
solutions (aka keys) are items that can be used to remove problems from the map
Enemies

Anxieties are moving obstacles that can be attacked and killed by the player. Their presents decreases the hope and are to be killed as fast as possible.
Goblins appear throughout the caves, they’ll try to charge and kill the boy upon seeing him but are extremely weak towards light and especially fire, so they have to be countered as soon as they appear.

Goal

The kid must get out of the cave before his hope is lost, as in the torchlight fading out, hence the name.
